My name is Shreyas Bhave. I'm currently a PhD student at the Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI). My research interests are broadly in modeling EHR data for the purposes of developing risk prediction models. In particular, I am interested in developing methods which address the inherent biases in such data. My recent work focuses on approaches to better model multi-scale irregularly sampled time series data and detecting missingness in tabular data. 

Prior to Columbia, I received my Bachelor's degree from UC Berkeley in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I spent a summer as a SWE intern at Counsyl, now <a href="https://myriadwomenshealth.com/"> Myriad Women's Health </a>, where I worked on buidling pipelines for processing large genomic datasets. I've also worked at Harvard Medical School and Johns Hopkins.
